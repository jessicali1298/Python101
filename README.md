## Python101
* This repository contains a simple Python notebook that outlines some basic data analysis tasks
* If you have Python installed and wish to test out the code, please go to my 7DayTemp folder to extract the data; the sample input data and the notebook are all saved in a folder called 'Python Tutorial', just copy the folder over and run the code using Jupyter Notebook
* If you don't have Python installed, unfortunately you can't test the code. However, you can still read the code on the browser
