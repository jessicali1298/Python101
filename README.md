## Python101
* This repository contains a simple Python notebook that outlines some basic data analysis tasks
* If you wish to test out the code, please go to my 7DayTemp folder to extract the data; save the data in the same folder as the Notebook and run the code from there
* If you don't have Python installed, unfortunately you can't test the code. However, you can still read the code on the browser
